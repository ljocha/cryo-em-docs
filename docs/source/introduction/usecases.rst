Use cases
=========
There are several use cases describing in which manner the user interact with the proposed system.  

Simple access
--------------------------
In this use case user does not have to deeply interact with described systems. User deliver sample with required data to lab. If sample and accompanying data are all right, the sample is scanned on the device. Information about the project is fill in the software by lab operator. After sample is scanned users get e-mail with URL, from where data can be downloaded. 

Sharing data with other users
-----------------------------
User have installed and set up own Oneprovider. User get a ``invite token`` by which is possible to replicate whole space with dataset to its infrastructure. 

Use in computing center
-------------------------------
Space is stored and accesible through an Oneprovider located in a computing centre. User can ask for specified computer node through ``Kubernetes``, ``Infrastructure manager`` and can perform desired computation.
